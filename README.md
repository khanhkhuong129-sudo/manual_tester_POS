# manual_tester_POS
During my internship as a Manual Tester at DimChan, I was responsible for executing manual test cases provided by the QA team to ensure the quality and stability of the system. I participated in testing core functionalities of the POS system, including order processing flows, payment-related features, and printer integrations such as USB, IP, and Cloud printers.

My main tasks included identifying software defects, documenting bugs clearly with detailed reproduction steps, expected and actual results, and attaching supporting evidence such as screenshots and logs. In addition, I collaborated with developers and other QA members to clarify issues and verify bug fixes. I also performed regression testing after fixes to ensure that new changes did not affect existing functionalities. Through this internship, I gained practical experience in manual testing processes, bug reporting, and cross-team communication within a real production environment.
